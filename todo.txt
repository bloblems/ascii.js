- Link -> instead of giving x, y... give a drawn layer. The link will be created
  from non null characters.

- create_color_layer([width, height])
- put_color(layer)
- tell that user can use mask on color layer
- tell that user can user most of other drawing function on color layers
  (background, line, shape, fill...)

- color_layer cell with [null, null] to handle font color and background color ?

- tell into README that ascii requires a monospace font !
