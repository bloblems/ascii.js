- text(x, y, string)
- make create_canvas(width, height, mode) with mode = true when width and height are given in pixels || or from css ?

- mouse events functions
- key_pressed()		function for user
- window_resized()	function for user

- Link -> instead of giving x, y... give a drawn layer. The link will be created
  from non null characters.
