- text(x, y, string)
- make create_canvas(width, height, mode) with mode = true when width and height are given in pixels || or from css ?
- key_pressed()		function for user
- window_resized()	function for user
- class Link (<a href="...">...</a>) with x, y, url and text (content) to be printable
- Link -> instead of giving x, y... give a drawn layer. The link will be created
  from non null characters.

- fill() -> background(); fill() should act like photoshop fill tool. You give
  it a point and a character and it recursively fill the space until border are
  reached.
